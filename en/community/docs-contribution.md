# Contributing to Dify Documentation

Dify documentation is an [open-source project](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs), and we welcome contributions. Whether you've spotted an issue while reading the docs or you're keen to contribute your own content, we encourage you to submit an issue or initiate a pull request on GitHub. We'll address your input promptly.

## How to Contribute

We categorize documentation issues into two main types:

- Content Corrections (Typos / Inaccuracies)
- Content Additions (New documentation)

### Content Errors

If you encounter errors while reading a document or wish to suggest modifications, please use the **"Edit on GitHub"** button located in the table of contents on the right side of the document page. Utilize GitHub's built-in online editor to make your changes, then submit a pull request with a concise description of your edits. Please format your pull request title as `Fix: Update xxx`. We'll review your submission and merge the changes if everything looks good.

Alternatively, you can post the document link on our [Issues page](https://github.com/langgenius/dify-docs/issues) with a brief description of the necessary modifications. We'll address these promptly upon receipt.

### Content Additions

To contribute new documentation to our repository, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository

Fork the repository to your GitHub account, then clone the repository to your local:

3. Submit a pull request

When submitting a pull request, please use the format `Docs: Add xxx` for the title and provide a brief description in the comment field. We'll review your submission and merge the changes if everything is in order.
