## 3. Use the tool

- **Chatflow / Workflow Applications**

Both Chatflow and Workflow applications support the `DALL-E` tool node. After adding it, you need to fill in the "Input Variables â†’ Prompt" in the node with [variables](https://docs.dify.ai/guides/workflow/variables) to reference the user's input prompt or the content generated by the previous node. Finally, use the variable to reference the image output by `DALL-E` in the "End" node.

- **Agent Applications**

Add the `DALL-E` tool in the Agent application, then send a picture description in the dialog box to call the tool to generate an AI image.
