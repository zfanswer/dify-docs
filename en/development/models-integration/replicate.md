# Replicate

Dify supports accessing [Language models](https://replicate.com/collections/language-models) and [Embedding models](https://replicate.com/collections/embedding-models) on Replicate. Language models correspond to Dify's reasoning model, and Embedding models correspond to Dify's Embedding model.



Specific steps are as follows:

1. You need to have a Replicate account ([registered address](https://replicate.com/signin?next=/docs)).
2. Get API Key ([get address](https://replicate.com/signin?next=/docs)).
3. Pick a model. Select the model under [Language models](https://replicate.com/collections/language-models) and [Embedding models](https://replicate.com/collections/embedding-models) .
4. Add models in Dify's `Settings > Model Provider > Replicate`.

The API key is the API Key set in step 2. Model Name and Model Version can be found on the model details page:
